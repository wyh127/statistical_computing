# Optimization


The goal of this lab is to write a simple optimization function in **R** which estimates the global minimum of a convex differentiable function $f(x)$.  Specifically, consider the function 
$$f(x)=\frac{-\log(x)}{1+x}, \ \ x>0,$$
where $\log(x)$ is the natural logarithm of $x$.  We seek to estimate the value of $x>0$ such that $f(x)$ achieves its global minimum.  For example, the global minimum of the function $g(x)=x^2-4x+3$ is at $x=2$. The minimum of $g(x)$ can easily be computed using the vertex formula for quadratic functions, i.e., $x=-b/(2a)=4/(2*1)=2$.  In most cases, the minimum does not have a closed form solution and must be computed numerically.  Hence we seek to estimate the global minimum of $f(x)$ numerically via gradient descent.    

# Tasks

1) Using **R**, define the function $$f(x)=\frac{-\log(x)}{1+x}, \ \ x>0.$$ Test the points $f(0)$ and $f(2)$.  
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  return (-log(x)/(x+1))
}
f(0)
f(2)
```
The calculation are provided above.

2) Plot the function $f(x)$ over the interval $(0,6]$. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
base <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(0, 6)), aes(x))
base + stat_function(fun = f) 
```

3)  By inspection, were do you think global minimum is located at?  
Somewhere around 4.

4) Define a **R** function which computes the difference quotient of $f(x)$, i.e., for $h>0$, 
$$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}.$$ This function should have two inputs; $h$ and $x$.  Name the difference quotient function **diff.quot**.  Note that for small $h$,  this function is the approximate derivative of $f(x)$.    
```{r}
diff.quot <- function(x, h=0.0001) {
  return ((f(x+h)-f(x))/h)
}
```

5) Plot both the difference quotient function **diff.quot** and $f(x)$ over the interval $(0,6]$.  Fix $h=.0001$ to construct this plot.  Comment on any interesting features.
```{r}
base + stat_function(fun = f) + stat_function(fun = diff.quot) 
```
It is interesting that the two functions intersects around point x = 1.5. And they have different monotonity.


6) Write a **R** function named **basic.grad.descent** that runs the basic gradient descent algorithm on the function $f(x)$.
The function should have inputs:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initial value  {\bf x}
\item Maximum iterations  {\bf max.iter} with default 10000. 
\item Stopping criterion {\bf stop.deriv} with default 1e-10. 
\item Derivative step size {\bf h} with default .0001.  
\item Step size {\bf step.scale} with default .5. 
\end{enumerate} The function should have outputs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The value $x$ that yields the minimum of $f(x)$. 
\item The minimum value of $f(x)$. 
\item The number of iterations the algorithm took to reach the minimum.
\item A logical indicator displaying whether or not the algorithm converged.  
\end{enumerate}

```{r}
basic.grad.descent <- function(x, max.iter = 10000, stop.deriv = 1e-10, h = .0001, step.scale = .5) {
  iter = 0
  prime = Inf
  x_init = x
  
  while((abs(prime) > stop.deriv) & (iter < max.iter)) {
    prime = diff.quot(x_init, h)
    x_init = x_init - step.scale * prime
    iter = iter + 1
  }
  
  res = list(x_res = x_init, f_res = f(x_init), iter_res = iter, conv = (iter < max.iter))
  
  return (res)
}

basic.grad.descent(1)
```


7)  Check the optimal value using the base **R** function **nlm()**.  
```{r}
nlm(f, 1)
```
Obviously, the result matches with that in 6) except the iterations.
